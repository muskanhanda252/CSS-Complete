        do you ever wonder why society was sculpted in the twisted and corrupted sense it is, today? why people are so
        fucking
        stuck on creating themselves into this person that they’re not,, just to feel like they’re good enough to be
        accepted by
        people who the majority of the time,, of the time,, don’t even matter ? our minds have all been possessed with
        this
        sickening belief in what it takes to be “enough”,, creating a form of life that has reached a level of
        inhumanity. be
        yourself, and whoever can’t accept you for that person, can’t accept humanity. you’re doing everything right. so
        just
        stop letting everyone tell you who and what you need to be.

        A universe where the sun shines as bright as your soul, and your love radiates around the planets. Where the
        hurricanes
        hit the shore harder than the emptiness of when you're gone and the oceans consume the entirety of who I am.
        It's a
        place of a million stars that shine so bright because they're powered by the chemistry between the two of us.
        And it's
        that large span of planets that I call home.

        But we're not in that universe. We're in this one.

        We're skin on skin and still I want to pull you closer.
        Saying 'I love you' just sounds too simple to explain how I feel about you.
        Sometimes I see you smile and I know that this is the face I want to wake up to for the rest of my life.
        In your arms I feel safe, it's like finally coming home.
        I think I just belong there.
        I belong to you.
