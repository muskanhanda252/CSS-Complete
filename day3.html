        <h3>A LITTLE POST:</h3>
        I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off. I love
        you
        as
        certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.
        I love you as the plant that never blooms but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers; thanks to your
        love
        a
        certain solid fragrance, risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.
        I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you straightforwardly, without complexities
        or
        pride; so
        I love you because I know no other way
        than this: where I does not exist, nor you, so close that your hand on my chest is my hand, so close that
        your
        eyes
        close as I fall asleep.
